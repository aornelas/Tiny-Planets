# Tiny Planets

Tiny Planets is a charming Virtual Reality game in which you look around to rotate the world and find items around it. Once you collect enough items, a portal to the next planet opens! You can play using Google Cardboard or by simply moving your phone around.

# Experiments

After publishing Tiny Planets, I developed a couple of spin-off prototypes which are also included in this project. You can play with them by loading their corresponding scenes in Unity.

## Black Holes

Use the gravity in Tiny Planets to throw planets towards black holes and play with orbital dynamics.

## Sphere Maze

Expand on the controls of Tiny Planets to manipulate a sphere maze and move the ball across ramps.
